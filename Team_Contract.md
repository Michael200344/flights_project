# **Team Contract**

### Communication:
1. Team Meetings:

We will meet whenever is required to meet our project goals. This may be between 1 and 4 times a week. Each meeting should last about an hour or enough time for each member to get on the same page. We will ideally meet in person but if that is not possible we will meet on zoom. We will taking notes on our meetings.

2. Assistance:

Our team has a groupchat designated for the project that will allow us to respond quickly. Each member will check this chat at least twice a day and make a conscious effort to participate and respond accordingly.

3. Respect:

We will make sure that everyone gets a chance to speak in every meeting. We will have a voting system to decide ideas. We will all make our best effort to respect the perspectives and opinions of others to make the group work as efficiently as possible.

### Collaboration:
1. Work Distribution:

We will divide up the work evenly amongst ourselves. Once we have a finalized plan for our project we will more accueretly be able to assure that everyone is doing their part and contributing equally for their own individual strenghts.

2. Time Commitment:

We are going to aim for 5 hours of work a week per person dedicated to this project. This means that over the next 4 weeks we will each contribute 20 hours towards developing our project. That's 80 hours total between all members. We all have other time commitments to other things of course, but we have all agreed to prioritize this project highly relative to our other assignments because it counts for a large portion of our grade in an important class. If a time conflict comes up, that person can put in more hours the next week to make up for their missed hours. Time conflicts will likely not occur though because we will be meeting together to work on the project, so we all have expectations for each other to show up.

3. Conflict Resolution:

All conflicts within the team will be decided through voting diplomatically. In the event of a tie between the votes, we will sit and discuss all the alternates and solutions as a group and come to a consensus. If this doesn’t work either, we can consult the TA for guidance and clarity on a topic.If any member is consistently late or hasn’t accomplished his tasks, then we will call a meeting and first understand his perspective and reason about why he hasn’t been able to do it and we can help him through whatever problem he is having. If the problem persists, we can involve the TA and about helping us with possible options about getting the specific team member in line.
